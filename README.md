An introduction to 3d modeling with SketchUp; course materials

Editable doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_FXVZu_G9MSZytMUvDIS1DZgSC1qqdBc_vuP3rxwa3I/edit

### Setup

1. Open https://app.sketchup.com/ and sign in
2. Go to https://github.com/jywarren/sketchup-class-intro or https://bit.ly/2rUvoYR and download everything
    * you can use this direct link to the .zip file: https://github.com/jywarren/sketchup-class-intro/archive/main.zip 


### Navigation

Open 00-navigation.skp

1. Views: standard, zoom (where pointer is), field of view, orbit - letter O
2. Find pink surface, green surface
3. Treasure hunt: find the 3 coins
4. Hand tool - letter H, plus push the scroll wheel to orbit


### Basic drawing

1. Make a basic cube - pencil letter L; each color is an axis - blue/red/green
2. Now let’s do a measured cube
    * Measure a distance - type 100, ENTER
    * Get on red axis, hold SHIFT, click original point
    * Finish it yourself
3. push/pull your old box to match your new box (ish)
4. Cut a hole in a box, push it in, push the walls of the hole; make a box with thickness


### Selection

1. Single/double/triple click, use letter M to move
2. Left & right drag (old box AND new box): select all you touch vs all that are completely contained
3. Delete a line, delete a plane
4. Scale - letter S - from corner or edge; preserve proportions
    * scale to a specific size - make one face of box 1 same height as box 2
    * now make it double height of box 1: 2 ways; first match, then double scale OR draw a guide line


### Project time! Make a box with a lid.

1. Make a box with specially shaped cutouts
2. Rotate from a specific axis: make a lid for your box and simulate the hinge
3. Make the box have 2 matching cutouts using the clone function
4. Make a “plug” for a cutout (by selecting the hole, copying it) 


### Homework: make a model of your kitchen and some of its contents

Start with a countertop/sink


### Tricks

1. Close a polygon by overdrawing a line
2. Extrude to only a certain height
3. Extrude a subset along a longer line, but not all the way (learn to mark a waypoint)


### Make a shelf

1. Open 01-printshop.skp
2. Walking - eye level
3. Groups, clone and interpolation
4. Isolation: a smaller workspace in a complex model: a book?
5. Components: editing inside/outside, scaling, stretching, making unique


### Curved surfaces: arcs, circles, imperfections

1. Draw a spoon
2. Follow-me tool


### Project time! Make a model of your bicycle or car



### Advanced

1. Textures: eyedrop, paint on like surfaces, transparency
2. Flip surfaces
3. Light and shadow
4. Line weight and style
5. Exporting
6. Cross-sections (inside a room)
